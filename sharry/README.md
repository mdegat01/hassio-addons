[Sharry][sharry] allows to share files with others in a simple way. It is a self-hosted
web application. The basic concept is: upload files and get a url back that can
then be shared.

## About

This addon allows for quick and easy file sharing. You drag and drop files in
and get a link you can share with anyone. And you can create & share spaces others
can use to share files you. Anyone with a share link can get to it but only authenticated
users can make new share links. And URLs are hard to guess so users can control
who has access. It also has some nice features like resumable file uploads and
gallery display for photos and videos.
